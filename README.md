## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Virtual environment tool (`venv` or `virtualenv`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-catalog-api.git
   cd ecommerce-catalog-api
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. Access the API documentation:
   - Swagger UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

## API Endpoints

| Method   | Endpoint                     | Description                |
|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/products`           | Get a list of products     |
| `GET`    | `/api/v1/products/{id}`      | Get product details by ID  |
| `POST`   | `/api/v1/products`           | Create a new product       |
| `PUT`    | `/api/v1/products/{id}`      | Update product details     |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/products/{id}`      | Delete a product           |

## Future Enhancements
1. Add authentication (JWT-based).
2. Add category and tagging functionality for products.
3. Implement product image uploads.
